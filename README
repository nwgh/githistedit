This extension makes 'hg histedit' work more like 'git rebase -i' (for
those of us, like me, with almost indefeatable muscle memory).

Basically, when telling 'hg histedit' what you want to do in your $EDITOR,
instead of using the default hg actions (which are similarly named, but not
exactly so to those from 'git rebase -i'), you get to use the ones from
'git rebase -i' that you're already used to. Pretty simple.

Obviously, you need mercurial installed and the histedit extension enabled
for this to do anything useful.

This is incredibly lightly tested. No guarantees this won't, y'know, totally
trash your repo or something.

To enable this, simply put the following in the hgrc of your choice:

[extensions]
histedit = 
githistedit = /path/to/githistedit/githistedit.py
